          <h2>Introduction to Bootstrap</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Bootstrap development was started by Twitter's Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton as an effort to develop an internal tool â€” a new framework to encourage consistency across internal tools at Twitter.
            During these early stages of development, Bootstrap was originally named "Twitter Blueprint."
            The new framework matured quickly and was released as an open-source project on August 19, 2011.
            The Bootstrap core team is continuing development, and the latest version is Bootstrap 3, which was released in August 2013.

            Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.
            It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
            Bootstrap is the seventh-most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 142,000 stars, behind freeCodeCamp (almost 312,000 stars) and marginally behind Vue.js framework.
            Bootstrap is a HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web apps).

          <h3>Getting Started With Bootstrap</h3>
          <p>
            If you are ready to start learning how to use Bootstrap, but you aren't already familiar with HTML and CSS, the first step to learning Bootstrap is to learn the basics of HTML and CSS.
            Basically, Bootstrap CSS needs to be referenced in the head section of your HTML files. JavaScript files are called at the end of the body section of your HTML files. This basic HTML structure is called a Bootstrap template using.
            Bootstrap comes down to applying its CSS classes and JavaScript to your HTML elements, therefore you need to have a good grasp of CSS and HTML. Luckily, this won't be an issue for serious developers.
